Data Cleaning
- NULL Values
- Duplicates
- Data Types
- Outliers
- Imputation
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy

Advanced Methods
- Encoding (Convert Strings into Numbers for Alogrithms)
- Transformation (Normal Distribution of Numerical Data)
- Scaling (Make each Feature the Same Relative Size)
- Normalization (Across an Observation, all features sum to 1)
- Libraries: Sci-Kit Learn Preprocessing, Category Encoders
